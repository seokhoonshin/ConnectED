# DS594_ConnectED Final Project: Data to Promote Student Belonging

## Overview
ConnectED promotes student mental health through coaching, training, program development, and evaluation. Using evidence-based solutions grounded in neuroscience and psychology, ConnectED fosters collaboration and resilience in communities.

This project focuses on leveraging network data to understand and promote students' sense of belonging and mental health.

---

## Project Goal
Use network data to analyze and foster a sense of belonging and mental health among students in St. Helens, OR middle and high schools.

---

## Dataset Background
- **Type:** Directed weighted social network graph
- **Size:** Over 2,000 nodes and 5,000 edges
- **Source:** Active Organizational Network Analysis (ONA) method
- **Metrics Included:** 
  - Student mental health indicators
  - Community involvement metrics
  - Demographic attributes (age, grade, race, gender, activity involvement)

---

## Tech Stack
- **Data Preprocessing and Cleaning:** ChatGPT, Python
- **Network Metrics Analysis:** Python, NetworkX
- **Data Visualization:** Tableau, Matplotlib

---

## User Story
**Belonging and Demographics:**  
*As a data analyst, I want to analyze how factors like age, grade, activity involvement, race, and gender correlate with students' sense of belonging, so that I can understand the demographic and activity-based influences on belonging.*

---

## Key Features
- **Network Analysis:**
  - Calculated network metrics such as centrality, clustering coefficients, and connectivity.
  - Identified key influencers in the social network.
- **Belonging Analysis:**
  - Explored correlations between demographic factors and students' sense of belonging.
  - Analyzed the impact of community involvement on mental health.
- **Visualizations:**
  - Created interactive dashboards in Tableau to illustrate insights.
  - Plotted network graphs using Matplotlib for node and edge analysis.

## Project Outcomes
- Identified demographic and activity-based factors that significantly influence a student's sense of belonging.
- Highlighted key nodes in the network for targeted interventions to improve student mental health.
- Provided data-driven recommendations to foster collaboration and resilience within the community.

---

## Future Directions
- Incorporate longitudinal data to analyze changes over time.
- Extend the analysis to include economic and geographic factors.
- Develop predictive models for identifying at-risk students based on network and mental health data.
